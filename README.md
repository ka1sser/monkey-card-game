_MONKEY CARD GAME_

This game is a classic Filipino card game wherein among the 52 cards, there will be a hidden card
and the remaining cards will be distributed amongst the players. Each players will then get all
the paired cards according to their number values and put it down and basically permanently out of
the game, after all the paired cards from each deck were remove, the game proper will now start.

The first player will get a random card from the deck of the player next to him/her and if the player
can form a pair with that card, the player will then remove the pair from his/her deck. The next player
will do the same.

The goal is to remove all your cards from your deck until only the remaining unpaired card is left and
that player loses.
